This game has 4 simple rules:
* Any live cell with less than 2 live cells around it, dies.
* Any live cells with more than 3 live cells around it, dies.
* Any live cell with 2 or 3 cells around it, lives.
* Any dead cell with 3 live cells around comes to life.

You'll be surprised by the patterns that can be generated by this simple 0 player game.

## Getting started

The dependencies are `pygame`, `sys`, `random` and `json` which can be installed using `pip`
```bash
pip install pygame sys random json
```

To get started with GameofLife, navigate to a directory where you want to use the project, then clone it with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AvinLT/ConwaysGameOfLife.git
```

Move into the directory that was just created (either through your filesystem or with `cd ConwaysGameOfLife`), and you are ready to go!

## User guide

### Adding a preset pattern

You would like ot add a pattern of your own or have found other patterns not already included, navigate to
`json/json_patterns`
and add a json file in the following format:

```bash
{
  "title": "Name_Of_File",
  "life": [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
}
```
The largest size of your pattern can be is the size of the in game grid, which is initially set at 100 x 100 but can be changed by going to `src/main.py` and changing the value of:
```bash
GRID_SIZE = [100, 100]
```
Note that a larger `GRID_SIZE` will slow down the game and will reduce `FPS` which is set at 30 by default.

After adding the json file, go to `json/names.txt` and add the name f you pattern in a new line.
Finally, run json_extract.py in the `json` directory to add your pattern to `all_patterns.json`.

## About

This project is definitely not the most efficient way to play Conway's Game of Life, but I was determined to try to create it with the knowledge for pygame I have.


I am still fairly new to GitHub and am still working on making my code readable and well-organised. I had a lot of fun making this and hopefully this isn't the worst code you've seen :)
